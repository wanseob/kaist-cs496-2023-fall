## Who Should Take This Course?

> **Important**
> The lecture scheduled for **October 11th** will be conducted **online [via Zoom](https://kaist.zoom.us/j/6873841846)**.


***


This course is perfect for students who are really interested in Ethereum, cryptography, and love the challenge of complex math. It's ideal for those who are into computer science or math
and are curious about how these areas are changing our world.

The course is led by a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, giving you a unique view of how cryptography is used in the real world. We'll be looking at some advanced ideas, but we'll make sure they are easy to understand. Having some background in math and computer science is helpful, but what we really value is your curiosity and eagerness to learn.

If you're excited to explore the latest in cryptography and see how it's used in practice, we can't wait to welcome you to this course!

> **Warning**
> Please note: This course will be delivered in **<u>Korean</u>** to facilitate a deeper understanding and exploration of complex concepts.


## Summary of Lecture

This course offers an in-depth exploration of advanced cryptography topics, focusing particularly on Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), their underlying mathematical principles, and their applications in modern cryptographic systems. Topics include basic cryptography, pairing-based cryptography, ZKPs such as zk-SNARK, lookup arguments, and a review of recent research in the field. Students will also complete hands-on projects.

## Material for Teaching

* Slides
* Additinoal reading materials and research papers will be provided throughout the course

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Attendance**: Students must attend at least 80% (9 out of 12) of the lectures. If a lecture is missed, students are required to self-study using provided materials, record a video summarizing the lecture content, and submit this for it to be considered as attended.

1. **Midterm Project**: Students are required to submit a midterm assignment demonstrating their ability to write ZKP circuits. Submission of the project, showing an understanding and engagement with the material, is mandatory for passing.

1. **Final Project**: The final project requires students to utilize lookup arguments within a practical context. Submission of the project, showing an understanding and engagement with the material, is mandatory for passing.

Not meeting the attendance requirement or not submitting one or both projects, demonstrating engagement with and understanding of the course material, will result in failing the course.
